PSEUDO CODE FOR GRAPHING ECLIPSE DATA

take time (given in ms) and subtract original timestamp to find difference
divide by 1,000 to get the new time (in s)

seconds / 60 / 60 = time in hours as whole number.
Take resulting decimal and multiply it by 60 to get time in minutes as whole number.
Take resulting decimal and multiply it by 60 to get time in seconds.

add the new HH:MM:SS values to original time of 13:04:42.
Ex. timestamp 20073161 will convert to 2:39:22 difference to get new timestamp of 15:44:04

plot the points of brightness with converted timestamp(s) using gnuplot
